Name,Default,Notes
USER_SW,OFF,"Connected to PB6D input of Crosslink FPGA."
SDO_EN,ON,"Enable/disable to SDO output of the GS2971A, which is buffered and exposed on the 'SDI Output' BNC."
AUDIO_EN,ON,"Enables/disables audio extraction fuctionality of the GS2971A."
IOPROC_EN,ON,"Enables/disables signal processing features of the GS2971A like error correction and level conversion."
20bit_10bit,OFF,"Used to select the output bus width. Must be set low for proper operation on this board."
SMPTE_BYPASS,OFF,"When on, the GS2971A carries out SMPTE scrambling and I/O processing. When OFF, GS2971A operates in data-through mode."
DVB_ASI,OFF,"Enables/disables DVB-ASI mode of the GS2971A."
SW_EN,OFF,"When OFF, the default state of GS2971A's SW_EN pin is low. A rising edge (via switch or FPGA GPIO) will cause the GS2971A to re-lock on the input video stream. Generally not needed unless the video source has been externally switched between two source"
TIM_861,ON,"When TIM_861 is HIGH, the GS2971A outputs CEA 861 timing signals (HSYNC/VSYNC/DE) instead of H:V:F digital timing signals."
RC_BYP,OFF,"When on, the serial digital output is the re-timed version of the serial input. When OFF, the serial digital output is simply the buffered version of the serial input, bypassing the GS2971A's internal reclocker."
STANDBY,OFF,"When on, the GS2971A is placed in a power-saving mode. No data processing occurs, and the digital I/Os are powered down."
JTAG_HOST,OFF,"When on, the GS2971A's host interface port is configured for JTAG test. When OFF, the GS2971A operates normally."
